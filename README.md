# MERN-social-media-app

This is a simple miniature social media app using the MERN stack with redux and redux persist as the state management.

To run this app on your machine locally, follow these steps:
1. Download or clone the repo to your machine
2. You would ideally want to go to your IDE and open up two terminals inside it, or you could use whatever terminal, or command line.
3. Inside both the terminals, use the cd command to go to the directory of where you locally saved the repo. You can do this by typing: cd <file/path/to/repo>
4. In one of the terminals, type: cd server/ to go into the server directory
5. Then type: npm install , this would install all dependencies required for the backend
6. Type: npm nodemon run start , this will start the server
7. Now in the other terminal, type: cd client/ to go into the client directory
8. Then likewise type: npm install , to install dependencies for the frontend
9. Then type: npm start , to start up the website.
10. You should now be redirected to your browser where the site is loaded up. If not, them simply just copy the link in the terminal and paste it into your browser and enter

Hopefully that helps. This was just a hobby/practise project to level up my skills with the MERN stack.
